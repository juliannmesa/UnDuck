# UnDuck
A Rubber Ducky wireless undetectable kinda thing.
### Hardware Setup
To set it up, you are going to need: 

 - ESP8266 (module or dev board)
 - Cheap chinese ST-Link v2 clone (recomended, [example](https://www.ebay.com/itm/ST-Link-V2-Programming-Unit-mini-STM8-STM32-Emulator-Downloader/381374717427?epid=9024991947&hash=item58cbb45df3:g:cM0AAOSwymxVO5Ab:rk:1:pf:0https://www.ebay.com/itm/ST-Link-V2-Programming-Unit-mini-STM8-STM32-Emulator-Downloader/381374717427?epid=9024991947&hash=item58cbb45df3:g:cM0AAOSwymxVO5Ab:rk:1:pf:0)) or just anything with an STM32F103 chip
 - Wire (either jumbers or just wire)
 - Soldering station (if you don't plan on using it with a bread board)
Assembly process on the wiki: HERE (Todo)

### Software Setup
Again, you are going to need:

 - Arduino IDE
   - ESP8266 core for arduino
   - [THIS](https://github.com/rogerclarkmelbourne/Arduino_STM32) STM32 core for arduino
 - USB to TTL converter (needed if you are buying the ST-Link)
